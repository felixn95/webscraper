    "To build a web-scraper that periodically fetches stock numbers from Decathlon and displays the updated results on a website, you’ll need a few components in your tech stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Scraper**:\n",
    "   - **Python libraries**: You can use `requests` to fetch the webpage and `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to parse the HTML. If the data is dynamically loaded with JavaScript, consider `selenium`.\n",
    "   - **Scraper logic**: Write functions to extract the stock numbers and any other relevant data from Decathlon's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backend Server**:\n",
    "   - **Framework**: Use a Python framework like Flask or Django. Flask is simpler and lighter, suitable for a straightforward task like this.\n",
    "   - **Scheduling**: Integrate a scheduler like `APScheduler` to run your scraping function every 10 minutes.\n",
    "   - **Database**: Optionally, store the results in a database like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for persistence and easier data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Frontend**:\n",
    "   - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: To display the data.\n",
    "   - **Data fetching**: Use AJAX to fetch the latest data from the server without needing to refresh the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deployment**:\n",
    "   - **Server**: Deploy your application on a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.\n",
    "   - **Domain**: If needed, purchase a domain name and configure DNS settings to point to your server.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Security and Compliance**:\n",
    "   - **Rate limiting**: Ensure your scraper does not hit Decathlon’s servers too frequently, to avoid being blocked.\n",
    "   - **User-agent**: Set a proper user-agent string in your requests to identify your bot.\n",
    "   - **Legal**: Check Decathlon’s `robots.txt` and terms of service to ensure compliance with their scraping policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:\n",
    "   - **Logging**: Implement logging to monitor the scraper’s health and debug issues.\n",
    "   - **Error handling**: Set up error notification (e.g., via email or Slack) if the scraping process fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview should help you get started on building and deploying your web-scraping server and website. Each component can be expanded based on your specific requirements and scalability needs."
